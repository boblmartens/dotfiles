Fork of Mike Vincent's "vim-story" (http://github.com/agile/vim-story/) for working with Rspec's plain text stories.

This provides the same functionality (i.e. syntax, indention rules) but for Cucumber features.

I'm not a vim expert so any help would be greatly appreciated. :)

TODO:
  * Add new Cucumber keywords
  * Add multi-language support
  * Take advantage of the 'cucumber' command to run features
  * File switching perhaps?
